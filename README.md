**Empowering Visually Impaired Users with AI-Driven Mobile Accessibility**  

Looqs.ai is an innovative mobile assistant designed to transform smartphones into fully accessible devices for blind and visually impaired users. By leveraging AI, real-time screen interpretation, and intuitive voice interaction, Looqs.ai simplifies navigation and enhances the smartphone experience.

## 📱 **About Looqs.ai**

Looqs.ai was created with the mission to make smartphones accessible to everyone, especially those for whom existing tools fall short. We combine advanced AI with accessibility features to deliver seamless interaction and a personalized experience for every user.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- **Intelligent Spoken Feedback**: Clear, detailed descriptions of what's on the screen and how to interact with it.
- **Smart Actions**: Proactively suggests actions and executes multi-step tasks.
- **Flexible Interaction**: Supports both voice commands and traditional gestures.
- **Personalized Experience**: Learns user preferences over time to offer tailored assistance.

## 🌍 **Why Looqs.ai?**

Smartphones should empower, not hinder. Existing solutions like TalkBack and Google Assistant are useful but limited in context and scope. Looqs.ai bridges the gap by providing a truly intuitive and adaptive solution, transforming how visually impaired users interact with their devices.

## 🔓 **Open Source & Privacy Commitment**

Looqs.ai prioritizes transparency and user trust. While the app requires access to screen content to assist users, we are committed to open-sourcing parts of the project, ensuring transparency and accountability in how your data is handled.

## 💡 **Why Android First?**

We’ve chosen to start with Android due to its flexibility and deep integration capabilities. With Android holding 70% of the global market share, Looqs.ai aims to bring accessible technology to a broader audience at an affordable price point.

## 🤝 **Collaborate with Us**

We are actively developing the Looqs.ai prototype and are seeking partnerships, sponsorships, and collaborators. If you're interested in contributing or supporting our mission, we’d love to connect!
